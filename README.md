hi, i'm audrey.

i'm a software developer with a soft spot for game development and making weird utilities. rust is my language of choice, but i'm familiar with a multitude of languages- ask me about why i feel [wren](https://wren.io) is a wonderful alternative to lua.

my pronouns are they or she, and you can reach me via [email](mailto:hello@rainy.garden) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/mintyproof).
